Personality attributes influencing Organizational Behaviour

1. Locus of Control: Locus of control is the belief regarding the outcome of their actions.
Certain people believe that their skills and abilities influence the outcome of the action. Others
believe that some external factors like fate or chance influence their result. According to
Robbins, individuals who believe that they control what happens to them are called Internals and
individuals who believe that what happens to them is controlled by outside forces such as luck or
chance are called Externals.

Certain implications of locus of control behaviour of the individuals in organisations are
described below:

a) Absenteeism: People having internal locus of control possess a belief that the health 1s under
their control. They inculcate good health habits and take proper care of their health. Thus, they
have lower rate of sickness. Therefore, absenteeism is less in these people.

b) Turnover: With respect to turnover, internals tend to take action and thus might be expected
to quit the jobs more readily, but they tend to be more successful on the job and more satisfied.

c) Decision-Making: People having external locus of control are more oriented towards intuitive
decision making. On the other hand, internals consider more information before taking decisions.
They are motivated by the achievements. They would like to control the outcome of the
decisions.

d) Motivation: Internals possess achievement motivation than externals that are just satisfied
with the available rewards.

e) Job Satisfaction: People having external locus of control are more dissatisfied on the jobs.
This is because of the belief that the outcome is not under their control. In the case of internals,
job satisfaction is more due to the belief that outcomes are the results of their actions.

f) Psychological Commitment: Externals are less involved in the jobs. Internals possess
commitment that is more psychological.

g) Social interactions: People having internal locus of control are more sociable and excited to
have social relationships to keep their identification and esteem.

The locus of control influences the job selection also. People having internal locus of control are
successful in the sophisticated jobs. Jobs having professional and managerial nature require
complex information processing ability, needs quick learning, initiative and independence of
actions are suitable to the people having internal locus of control. On the other hand, people
having external locus of control are suitable to well-structured and routine jobs. They are also
successful in those jobs that require complying the directions.

2. Machiavellianism:

Machiavellianism is "the employment of cunning and duplicity in statecraft or in general
conduct". The word comes from the Italian Renaissance diplomat and writer Niccolo
Machiavelli, who wrote // Principe (The Prince), among other works.

In modern psychology, Machiavellianism is one of the dark triad personalities, characterized by
a duplicitous interpersonal style, a cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and
personal gain.

Machiavellianism, often abbreviated Mach, is a_ personality trait that is characterized with the
use of manipulation to achieve power.
High Machs are those who would be considered highly manipulative, not easily persuaded, but
persuade others more than low Machs, successful in reaching their goals and tend to win more.
People with a high Mach personality tend to be calm, unattached, calculated and look for ways to
exploit loose structures or vulnerability in people. High Machs flourish in face-to-face settings
where there are limited rules and structure and when emotions hold little value in goal
achievement. Therefore, high Machs are best matched in professions that reward their ‘do
whatever it takes' attitude such as sales or jobs that offer commission for results.

Low Machs are on the opposite side of the Mach spectrum and are characterized as being highly
submissive. Those individuals with a low Mach orientation are willing to accept direction
imposed on them and thrive in highly structured situations. Low Machs are less motivated by
things such as power, status, money and competition than high Machs are. Winning is not
everything for low Machs; they operate with a much higher set of ethical standards than their
high Mach counterparts.

Machiavellianism can be both positive and negative in organizations depending on how it is
used. When Machiavellianism is used to increase managerial effectiveness by providing
necessary direction to subordinates to accomplish organizational goals, it is considered a positive
attribute. However, when Machiavellianism is used for personal gain at the expense of
subordinate or organizational success, it would be considered highly negative.

3. Self-esteem: Self-esteem is a feeling of liking or disliking of one self. It 1s related to the
individual desire for success. A person having a greater desire for success is rated as high selfesteem person. He believes that he possesses required abilities to succeed on the jobs. People
with high esteem are risk takers. They tend to choose risky and challenging jobs. They have
internal locus of control. They give preference to pride, recognition, flair, success, independence,
and are satisfied with higher order needs than simple monetary motivation. On the other hand,
people having low self-esteem are influenced by the external factors. They give more respect and
importance to the opinions of others. They do not want to face unpleasant situation. Thus, they
try to please others.

4. Self-monitoring: Self-monitoring is the ability to adapt to the situational demands.
Individuals possessing high score on self-monitoring observe the behaviour of others from close
angle in order to adjust their behaviour. They like mobility in their career. They are more
successful in discharging contradictory roles. Simply they can wear a mask suitable to the
situation. Thus, there is high degree of behavioural inconsistency in high self-monitoring people.
Therefore, self-monitoring attribute helps managers to understand the personality and behaviour
of their subordinates in order to direct, communicate, motivate and regulate them on the jobs.

5. Self-Efficacy: Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief that he or he is capable of
performing a task. The higher your self-efficacy, the more confidence you have in your ability to
succeed in a task. So, in difficult situations, we find that people with low selfefficacy are more
likely to lessen their effort or give up altogether whereas those with high self efficacy will try
harder to master the challenge. In addition, individuals high in self-efficacy seem to respond to
negative feedback with increased effort and motivation; those low in self-efficacy are likely to
lessen their effort when given negative feedback. Individuals with high self-efficacy believes that
they have the ability to get things done, that they are capable of putting forth the effort to
accomplish the task, and that they can overcome any obstacles to their success.
There are four sources of self-efficacy:

¢ Prior experiences;

¢ Behaviour models - witnessing the success of others;

¢ Persuasion from other people; and

¢ Assessment of current physical and emotional capabilities.

Believing in one's own capability to get something done is an important facilitator of success.
There is strong evidence that self-efficacy leads to high performance on a wide variety of
physical and mental tasks. Managers can help employees develop their selfefficacy. This can be
done by providing performance, and rewarding employee's achievements.

6. Risk taking Attitude: Risk taking is an attitude. Persons differ in the attitude towards
assuming the risk. The propensity to take risk influences the decision-making. High-risk takers
are likely to take rapid decisions. Risk taking is also related to the job demands. High-risk taking
is found in certain caste, religion, nationality and gender. In organizations, risk-taking behaviour
is related to the ability of employees to take up challenging tasks and possess high achievement
motivation.

7. Positive/Negative Affect: Individuals who focus on the positive aspects of themselves,

other people, and the world in general are said to have positive affect. In contrast, those who
accentuate the negative in themselves, others, and the world are said to possess negative affect.
Employees with positive affect are absent from work less often. Individuals with negative affect
report more work stress. Negative individual affect produces negative group effect and this leads
to less cooperative behaviour in the work group. Managers can do several things to promote
positive effect, including allowing participative decision making and providing pleasant working
conditions.

8. Type A and Type B Personality: Type A behaviour pattern is a complex of personality and
behavioural characteristics, including competitiveness, time urgency, social status insecurity,
aggression, hostility and a quest for achievements. Type A _ personality individual is
"aggressively involved in a chronic struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time, and
if required to do so, against the opposing efforts of other things or other persons".

Type A personality:

¢ Are always moving, walking, and eating rapidly:

¢ Feel impatient with the rate at which most events take place;

¢ Strive to think or do two or more things simultaneously;

¢ Cannot cope with leisure time; and

¢ Are obsessed with numbers, measuring their success in terms of how much of everything they
acquire.

The alternative to the Type A behaviour pattern is the Type B behaviour pattern. People with
Type B personalities are relatively free of the Type A behaviours and characteristics. Type B
personalities are "rarely harried by the desire to obtain a wildly increasing number of things or
participate in an endless growing series of events 1n an ever decreasing amount of time”.

Type B personality:

¢ Never suffer from a sense of time urgency with its accompanying impatience;

¢ Feel no need to display or discuss either their achievements or accomplishments unless such
exposure 1s demanded by the situation;

¢ Play for fun and relaxation, rather than to exhibit their superiority at any cost; and

¢ Can relax without guilt.
